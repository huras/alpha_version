How to connect them?
How to store choices.

Event 1 - 
    background: ['forest']
    text: "There is the blacksmith"
    characters: ['Lanna'],
    mugshot: {'lanna'}
    name: "Lanna"
    next_events: [{event_id: 2, text_choice: 'Say nothing'}, {event_id: 4, text_choice: 'Thank you!'}]
Event 2 - 
    background: ['forest']
    text: ["I'm going now. Bye"]
    characters: ['Lanna'],
    mugshot: {'lanna'}
    name: "Lanna"
    next_events: [{event_id: 3}]
Event 3 - 
    background: ['forest']
    text: []
    characters: [],
    mugshot: {}
    next_events: [] //deadline
Event 4 - 
    background: []
    text: ["I'm going now. Bye"]
    mugshot: {}
    name: "Lanna"
