Develop two oposing teams of characters.
Team 1 is the protagonist team (not necessarily good)
Team 2 is the antagonist team (not necessarily evil)

Both teams will be developed taking into accout that their group is in strongest of their "carrers".
They will not be the strongest at the same time, so it should be possible to make a story where the protagonist team is stronger than the antagonist team, and vice versa during some time of the story.
